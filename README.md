### Project Domain: Health and Fitness

#### Description:
The application serves as a comprehensive health and fitness tracker, aiming to promote better lifestyle choices among its users. Key features include:

Caloric Intake Calculator: Allows users to input their daily food consumption, and the app calculates the total caloric intake based on the nutritional value of the chosen foods.

Caloric Expenditure Estimator: Users can log their daily physical activities, from walking to more intensive workouts. The app then provides an estimation of the number of calories burned during these activities, taking into account the user's weight and duration of the activity.

BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator: By entering their height and weight, users can quickly determine their BMI, which is a widely used metric to gauge whether one's weight is in a healthy range.

Weight Tracking: Users can log their weight regularly, allowing them to monitor their progress over time. The app provides a visual representation (e.g., graphs) of the user's weight trends, helping to motivate or inform adjustments to their fitness journey.

This application acts as a personal health assistant, providing users with insights and feedback about their dietary habits, physical activity, and weight management, all in one consolidated platform.
